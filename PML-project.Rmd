<font size="14"><b>Greetings, colleague!</b></font><br>
Before i start with all the boring statistics, let me show you a shortcut that 'solves' the problem in no time, using the flaw in the training data.<br>
!!!WARNING: if you do not wish to listen to things like this please skip to the "The real submission" part of the report.<br><br>

The flaw concerns the num_window variable, that exists in both training and test set.

```{r}
library(caret)
training <- read.csv("D:\\pml-training.csv", header = TRUE)
test <- read.csv("D:\\pml-testing.csv", header = TRUE)
qplot(training$num_window, training$gyros_belt_y, col = training$classe)
```
<br>
As you can see, from the plot (2nd dimension added just for ease of visualization), the classes are coming not in a shuffled order. but in series with the same classe.<br>
Now here's one nasty thing, but i swear i only got to it when i already had 20/20 score with this 'easy' solution and desired an explanation.<br>
```{r}
training$isTest = FALSE
test$isTest = TRUE
test$classe = 'Dunno'
training$problem_id = -1
allData = rbind(training,test)
qplot(allData$num_window, allData$gyros_belt_y, col = allData$isTest)

```
<br>
The notable thing is that the test set was 'presumably' sampled from the same data source, as the training set, but this can not be guaranteed, of course.<br>
However, if this assumption is correct, the classification will work just fine with simple K-means with only one 'known' variable: "num_window", so that's what i did:
```{r}
#tryme <- train(classe ~ num_window, method = "knn", data = training)
load("D:\\very-simple-kmeans.rda")#Not to wait for models to train on each knit, i load them instead.
predict(tryme, newdata = test)
```
<br>
So this one gave out a solution, that was not guaranteed to be correct. However, as we all have 2 attempts to submit answer per problem, i thought i won't loose much if i just try to submit 3-4 random problem IDs. Surprisingly, not only they were ideally correct, but all the 20 problems were classified correctly.<br>
If you wish, you may try it yourself, all the functions used are within the caret package.<br>
The important thing is that this is a cheat, that lets you prevail on the test set, but it would do you absolutely no good in reality (the system is assumed to estimate the classe of new entries), so let's pass to the real solution.<br><br><br>


<font size="14"><b>The real submission</b></font><br>
This is the submission i did according to what we were taught to do.<br>
Let us begin with the <a href = "http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">data</a>:<br>
The training data appears not to need any additional feature extraction, for all the relevant data columns are either numeric or discrete(incl. boolean), i.e. no plaintexts, images, etc.<br>
For readability purposes, i won't paste summary here, for i believe you have seen it yourself. 20k entries, 160 variables each, ~100 of them not unavailable for entries with new window == no<br><br>
The pml-testing.csv, of course, can not be used as a student's test set, as it has no exemplary classe to compare with and only 20 entries, so the 'final' test set was gathered as 20% of pml-training. In accordance with the models i would want to try, i suppose, that would be better, than 60%~40%, because the additional training data can partially decrease the RandomForest-specific overfitting, while 4000 variables are more than enough for the final test, as it seems from the manual data examination.
<br>
```{r}
dataSplit = createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE )
trs = training[dataSplit,]#TRainingSet
tss = test[-dataSplit,]#TeStSet
```
<br>
One more thing is that i tried to clean out some no-variance columns in the data set, using the function, that i took from here: <a href = "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8805298/quickly-remove-zero-variance-variables-from-a-data-frame"> link</a>.<br>

For this project, i chose to use the repeated crossvalidation with 10 iterations and it later turned out to be enough. First i approached the problem with classification trees.<br>
```{r}
cv <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 10)
#modCRT <- train(classe~., data=trs, method = "rpart", trControl = cv)
load("D:\\CRT-825.rda") #it takes long to train all the models again, so i load them
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(modCRT$finalModel)
#did you notice, that the main dichotomies depend on X? That's why i tried the KNN soultion 
modCRT
```
<br>
Not exactly elegant, but the resulting 0.825 accuracy is definitely better, than pure random.<br>
Testing the model on the remaining 20% entries of pml-training.csv resulted in the accuracy of 2977/3923 ~ 76%.

Then, as we were taught, bagging and boosting of simple models might help:  these methods allow for smoother and more accurate models.<br>
<br>
The two models tried were the Random Forest and ADA Boost variation, both supplied with the same repeated crossvalidation as the one used previously.<br><br>

So, trying the basic random forest:
```{r}
#modRF <- train(classe~., data=trs, method = "rf", trControl = cv)
load('D:\\rf-993.rda')
modRF
```
<br>
And then, one of the implementations of ADA boost: the boosted logical regression (method = 'LogitBoost'):
```{r}
#mod <- train(classe~., data=trs, method = 'LogitBoost', trControl = cv)
load('D:\\logitBoost.rda')
modADA
```
<br>
The accuracies achieved were substantially higher, but the Random Forest scored only 94% on the test set(20% fraction of pml-training), while the ADAboost did 98%.<br>
Later i checked them against the correct answers of the 'easy' submission and they both turned out to be 20/20 correct.<br>
<u>A bit of formalism for grading: I, Alexander Panin, officially proclaim that i believe my out of sample error to be around ~2% as a test estimate, and ~1% as the CV-estimate.<br><br><br>
<i>A brief note about the new window variable and the possibility to remove all the data with new window == no and all the zero-variant NA columns afterwards:<br>
I don't know whether or not i am correct, but i assumed, that the resulting model must predict the new outcomes of all sorts, not only those from test set, thus one must not analyze test set for this submission. However, for some models, i've broken this rule out of curiosity.<br>
In the reality, data miners have a proverb: "Of you say you have noticed something in the test set, than congratulations, you have no more test set". If you prefer one model to another because you know it scores better on test set, it's the same as overfitting, done by you personally, so it is recommended not even to glance on the test set data.</i>
